It's here. It's big. It's gigantic. It's good, too. Merry late christmas!

OpenBST is now **officially out.** No more betas, no more Release Candidates. Which will probably result in a slightly buggy release.

Everything was updated to be as nice as possible, and new modules allow you to do much more.

## Everything new :
* New modules were added : SSB, IMG, BRM and BDF. SSB allows you to add sound to your BST file, IMG allows you to set a background image for a node, BRM manages the resources used by all the other modules, and BDF is a way to store descriptions when using very advanced scripting (it's kinda like Object Oriented but without objects)
* New icons in OpenBST to provide more control on the way files are played : Mute, Background Visible and a button to see the background in full.
* Tons of bug fixes!
* Debugging your BST file is also easier now, with line information added to ALL errors
* Added actions : "bound" for making sure a variable is within specific bounds, and "call" to execute a logical node without actually continuing to it, as well as "rand" to generate random numbers
* Made the syntax easier. There are tons of stupid restrictions that were removed, feel free to re-read the documentation to check them out
* And, of course, updated the documentation!

### Share and use the "Requires BST" badge!
Spread the word! We also have a Requires BST badge you can use when sharing your .bst files! *Note for developers : While a small bugfix here and there is always appreciated, please don't look too much at the source code, your eyes may bleed.*

### Test
Want to test features before anyone else? You can easily build OpenBST from source using the following commands. This assumes you have Git and the JDK installed.

    git clone -b dev https://github.com/utybo/BST
    cd BST

We first clone the branch "dev" (which is where development happens, as the normal "master" branch is always stable). Then, on Windows

    gradlew run

Or on anything else

    ./gradlew run

Do note that this branch is extremely unstable! If you wish to update the branch, simply use

    git pull
