UPDATE : My personal life has gotten a lot better since when I made this message. I am currently developping some more features and I'll try to release an update asap. Main lesson taken from this : don't ever try to package something for Linux.

TL;DR : OpenBST will not be developed anymore. (Not that anyone will miss it)

Yes, it's over. After over a year of irregular development I'm bringing this stupid, useless project to an end. I guess it was useful in that I learnt a few things, particularly how painful Java is for desktop apps. And how painful packaging is. And how painful LibreOffice can be. And how painful dev is in general. It's 1:30 am and after looking at some final solutions to make OpenBST work with snapcraft (a packaging thing for Linux) to maybe be able to do a thing properly for once, I'm just going to give up.

I may or may not release a final beta, since I added a weak editor (but hey it works, kinda). Sorry to the 0 people I'm disappointing with this... But yeah. I have 0 reason to keep this thing going. It's completely useless and I'm wasting everybody's time with it.

So, bye. A year of irregular work goes to waste. Work that has had exactly 0 purpose. Not sure if I'll ever do anything dev-related in the future to be honest, this project just makes me feel like no matter how hard you work, you'll just always be disappointed.

I wish I had any postive thought, but I don't. Nothing has worked properly, and I just can't get things done correctly. Why continue doing something useless? No one, *no one* cares about this program, not even myself. Maybe I'm wrong and there's a dude out there writing a story. If you are, good for you, but you should look at other solutions for this. There are other programs out there that are just *better*.

But hey who knows maybe one day I'll have a great idea. Spoiler : I most probably won't... I guess I'd need some kind of confirmation that what I'm doing isn't useless, but honestly, this is not worth it. And OpenBST is just objectively crap. It's ugly, it uses text files when everyone expects a simple editor, it's just... bad. And certainly not decent by the 21st century's standard.

OpenBST is just useless garbage. It's time to end the useless garbage. I'm tired of making something that no one will ever use.
